This code trying to keep the Value of it and the it Value in Roman in the list call roman_list

and have a roman_parts that keep the symbol

the key of this problem is we have to know how we convert the integer to roman 
lets say we want to convert 98 to roman 
1. we have to look down what the number in roman that less than 98 so it is 90 that is 'XC'
2. so we add 'XC' to the roman_parts can subtract 90 from 98 that mean it has only 8 that we don't know what it is in roman
3. as same as step 1 we gonna get 'V' and do the step 2 again
4. we loop until the integer number is 0

to use the program , the user can run it through python or in VSCode
